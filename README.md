# Iron Bank of Etheros
A gamified educational tool that teaches concepts of the Eth-space, while allowing to have loads of fun.

## Steps to run it on your machine
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
```
npm run dev
```
It'll ask you setup the port on a new location if you have the server running too. So usually you can access the dev site at `http://localhost:3001` or if you're only running the dev mode, it'll also be on `http://localhost:3000`.
